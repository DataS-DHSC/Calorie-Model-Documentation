## Running the Model

To run the calorie model you must have R installed (if in DHSC you must have fixed projects by running the solution [in section 1 here](http://51.140.241.138/github/mattm_dhsc/r-at-dhsc/src/branch/master/why_projects.md))

1. Copy the folder `\\ims.gov.uk\DHSC\London\SKH\NW012\EOR3\COP\Calorie Model - Proposed file structure\Calorie Model 2 - Full copy` to your local machine and rename it as a folder called `[Policy]-[yyyymmdd]-[analyst name]`. For example, if Edward Beake was running a model simulation for the advertising policy on 21/10/2019 the copy of the folder `Calorie Model 2 - Full copy` would be renamed `Advertising-20191021-EBeake`. (This will take a few minutes).

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

src_files <- list.files("../../Calorie Model 2 - Full copy/", recursive = T, full.names = T,
                       pattern = "\\.R$")


find_libraries <- function(file){
 

  src <- read_lines(file) 
  str_subset(src, "(library|require)") %>%
    
    str_extract("\\(\\w*\\)") %>%
    str_remove("\\(") %>%
    str_remove("\\)") 
  
  
}
libraries <- map(src_files,find_libraries) %>%
  unlist() %>%
  unique() %>%
  str_subset("\\w") %>%
  str_replace_all("(^|$)", "'") %>%
  str_flatten(collapse = " , ")

install_string <- str_glue("install.packages(", libraries, ")")
```

2. Install the required packages: `r install_string`.



3. Open the R project file `Calorie Model 2 + git.Rproj` in the renamed folder.

4. From the `/src/Model code` sub folder open the main code file `Calorie Model 2.0.2.R`, if this code file is not open.

```{r fig.cap='Select main code folder', out.width='100%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center',echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
include_graphics(rep("images/Calorie Model - main folder.png"))
```

```{r fig.cap='Open main code file', out.width='100%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center',echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
include_graphics(rep("images/Calorie Model - main file.png"))
```

5. Run the model with `Ctrl+1` then `Ctrl+A+ENTER`

6. Follow the on screen instructions in the pop up boxes.

A full model run will take a few minutes, the exact time the model takes will depend on the parameters specified the step 6 (NOTE: Some warning messages - these appear in red on the R console - are expected and should not concern the user.). After the model is finished:

* The model will be saved, using the name specified in the last pop up box of step 6, as an `.rds` file in the new sub-folder `model`. This file can be loaded into R and contains the complete details of your model

* The model summary report will be saved in the new sub-folder `report`.

* Delete the sub-folder `data` from the folder `[Policy]-[yyyymmdd]-[analyst name]` and archive the entire folder `[Policy]-[yyyymmdd]-[analyst name]`, by moving it to the archive folder `\\ims.gov.uk\DHSC\London\SKH\NW012\EOR3\COP\archive`, this is done to maintain a full audit trail of the model run.

## Developing the Model

The majority of molded developments, updating states and transition probabilities to add new diseases or change the obesity related prevalence increase, are made in the [model input files][Model Parameters and Data -`/heemod data`].
